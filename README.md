### Hello Everyone !
I would like to share my labwork with you. These lab works regarding to "How to codding clearily and smoothly with Java."

 #### Let's give example for each situtation.
- **First lab** is regarding Abstract Classes. I made up simply example for that.
<br />Abstraction may also be defined as the process of identifying only the required characteristics of an object ignoring the irrelevant details. The properties and behaviors of an object differentiate it from other objects of similar type and also help in classifying/grouping the objects.<br />
<br />Consider a real-life example of a man driving a car. The man only knows that pressing the accelera- tors will increase the speed of a car or applying brakes will stop the car, but he does not know how on pressing the accelerator the speed is actually increasing, he does not know about the inner mechanism of the car or the implementation of the accelerator, brakes, etc in the car.<br />
<br />
- **Second lab**, I have made program abide by the **Law Of Demeter.**
<br />**Context:**
<br />1- The Law of Demeter or principle of least knowledge is a design guideline for developing software, particularly object-oriented programs. Formally definition, the Law of Demeter requires that a method m of an object O may only invoke the methods of the following kinds of objects. 
<br />2- Demeter’s law is known as “don’t talk to strangers” because: Each unit should have only limited knowledge about other units — only units “closely” related to the current unit. Each unit should only talk to its friends — don’t talk to strangers. Only talk to your immediate friends.<br />
<br />
- **Third one's** subject is regarding **Inheritance and Minimizing Interface Problems.** 
<br />**Context:**
<br />1- If several routines use similar parameters, put the similar parameters in a consistent order
<br />2- The order of routine parameters can be an aide-memoire, and inconsistent order can make param- eters hard to remember
Use all the parameters
<br />3- If you pass a parameter to a routine, use it.
<br />4- If you aren’t using it, remove the parameter from the routine interface. 
<br />5– Unused parameters are correlated with an increased error rate.
Don’t use routine parameters as working variables
<br />6- It’s dangerous to use the parameters passed to a routine as working variables – Use local variables instead.
<br />7- Unused parameters are correlated with an increased error rate.
